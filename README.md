Task 2: Automated Report Generation Using Python

Introduction

This project has been developed as part of the CODTECH Python Programming
Internship. Task 2 focuses on automating the process of report generation
using Python. The objective of this task is to read data from a file,
analyze the data, and generate a formatted PDF report using Python
libraries such as ReportLab or FPDF.

Automated report generation is widely used in real-world applications
where data needs to be summarized and presented in a professional format.
This task helps in understanding how Python can be used to transform raw
data into structured and readable reports without manual effort.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective

The main objectives of this task are:
- To read structured data from an external file
- To analyze and process the data using Python
- To generate a formatted PDF report automatically
- To understand file handling and report automation concepts
- To present data in a clear and professional document format

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tools and Technologies Used

The following tools and libraries were used to complete this task:
- Python for implementing the automation logic
- Pandas for reading and analyzing input data
- ReportLab / FPDF for generating the PDF report
- File handling techniques for managing input and output files

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input Data Description

The input data for this task is stored in a file format such as CSV.
The file contains structured data that can be easily read and processed
using Python. The data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, which allows
efficient analysis and manipulation. This step ensures that the data is
cleaned and ready for report generation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation Details

The implementation begins by reading the input data file using Pandas.
Once the data is loaded, basic analysis is performed such as calculating
summary statistics or extracting key values required for the report.

After processing the data, a PDF report is generated using a Python
PDF library. The report includes headings, formatted text, and structured
content to make it easy to read and professional in appearance. The layout
is designed programmatically so that the report can be generated
automatically every time the script is executed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output and Results

The final output of this task is a formatted PDF report generated
automatically from the input data file. The report clearly presents the
analyzed data in a readable format. A sample report file is included in
the repository to demonstrate the output of the script.

This automated approach reduces manual effort and ensures consistency
in report generation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deliverables

The following files are included in this repository:
- report_generator.py  
  A Python script that reads data, analyzes it, and generates the PDF report.

- sample_report.pdf  
  A sample output PDF generated by the script.

- input_data_file.csv  
  The input data file used for generating the report.

- README.md  
  Documentation explaining the task, implementation, and output.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

This task demonstrates how Python can be used to automate report generation
efficiently. It provides practical experience in file handling, data
analysis, and document generation. The project successfully fulfills the
requirements of Task 2 of the CODTECH Python Internship and highlights the
use of Python for building automated reporting solutions.
